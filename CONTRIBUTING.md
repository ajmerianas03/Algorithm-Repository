# 🤝 Contributing to Algorithm Repository

First off, **thank you** for considering contributing! 💖 Your contributions help make this repository a valuable resource for everyone learning algorithms in **C++** and **Java**.

---

## 📌 How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

1. **Add New Algorithms**

   * Implement a new algorithm in **C++** and/or **Java**.
   * Follow the **file structure**: `Category/Language/AlgorithmName.extension`.
   * Use the **algorithm template** (description, time/space complexity, clean code, sample input/output).

2. **Improve Existing Algorithms**

   * Optimize code or improve readability.
   * Fix bugs or incorrect logic.
   * Add missing comments or explanations.

3. **Documentation & README Updates**

   * Add examples, explanations, or images.
   * Correct typos and formatting issues.

4. **Report Issues**

   * Open an issue if you find a bug or inconsistency.
   * Suggest new algorithms or improvements.

## 🏗️ Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**

2. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/AlgorithmName
   ```

3. **Make your changes**

   * Keep commits small and meaningful.
   * Follow **PascalCase** naming for files.

4. **Test Your Code**

   * Ensure your algorithm works correctly.
   * Include sample input/output if applicable.

5. **Push Your Branch & Create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/AlgorithmName
   ```

   * Describe your changes clearly.
   * Link any related issues if applicable.

## 🧭 Code Standards

* Use **PascalCase** for filenames: `MergeSort.cpp`, `DFS.java`.
* Include **comments**:

  * Purpose of the algorithm
  * Time complexity
  * Space complexity
  * Sample input/output (optional but recommended)
* Keep code **clean and readable**.
* Avoid global variables unless necessary.
